# basic-sign-language-translator
Developed a Python-based real-time sign language translator using OpenCV and MediaPipe.
Recognizes multiple static hand gestures (e.g., Hello, Yes, No, I Love You) and converts them to speech.
No dataset required; uses rule-based logic and hand landmark detection for accurate interpretation.
